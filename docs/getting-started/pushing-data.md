# Pushing data

This guide walks you through how to put data online using **data** and the DataHub.

`data` is the command-line tool to prepare, push and get data. With `data` you will be able to:

* Push data to the DataHub
* Get data from the DataHub (and elsewhere)
* Get information about data files and datasets
* Validate data to ensure its quality

```
data push my.csv
```

Example:

```
A,B,C
1,2,3
4,5,6
```
