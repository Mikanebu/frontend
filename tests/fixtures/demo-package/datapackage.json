Since volatility often signifies financial turmoil, VIX is\n> often referred to as the \"investor fear gauge\".\n>\n> VIX measures market expectation of near term volatility conveyed by stock\n> index option prices. The original VIX was constructed using the implied\n> volatilities of eight different OEX option series so that, at any given time,\n> it represented the implied volatility of a hypothetical at-the-money OEX\n> option with exactly 30 days to expiration.\n> \n> The New VIX still measures the market's expectation of 30-day volatility, but\n> in a way that conforms to the latest thinking and research among industry\n> practitioners.
